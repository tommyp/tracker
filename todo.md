## Reporting

I didn't get to the reporting, but my implementation of Goals and GoalEntries should've allowed for easy ways to display the data on a calendar-like view and display the streaks in other infographics.

## Changing goal types

There's a possible bug where a user has created Goal Entries but then changes the goal's type. I've got around this by disabling the Type input on edit but it would be nice to handle this in a better way and not lose progress against a goal.
